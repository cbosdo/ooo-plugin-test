Create the project idl files in this directory. The IDL types
definitions should follow these rules:

  + Only one IDL type per file
  + Each module have to be mapped to a directory

Thus, to create the type my::idl::Type, this directory have to 
contain the following file hierarchy:

   / my
     / idl
       / Type.idl
